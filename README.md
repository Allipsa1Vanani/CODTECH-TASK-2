## Overview of the Project

### Project: DEPLOYING A WEB APPLICATION ON AWS

### Objective
The objective of this project is to teach the fundamentals of deploying a web application on AWS. It involves setting up and configuring an AWS server (EC2 instance). The project guides deploying a simple web application on this server. It also covers basic cloud deployment principles. The aim is to provide hands-on experience with AWS cloud services for hosting web applications.

### Purpose Of The Project
The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience in deploying a web application on AWS. It aims to teach the basics of cloud computing, including server setup, configuration, and application hosting. The project focuses on utilizing AWS services like EC2 for deployment. It helps build foundational skills in cloud deployment and management.

### Key Activities
- **Setting Up AWS Account:** Create and configure an AWS account to access cloud services.
- **Launching an EC2 Instance:** Deploy and configure a virtual server to host the application.
- **Configuring the Server:** Install necessary software, such as a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx), on the EC2 instance.
- **Deploying the Web Application:** Upload and host the web application files on the server.
- **Testing and Accessing:** Test the deployed application by accessing it through the provided public IP or domain name.

### Technologies Used
- **Amazon EC2:** Used to create and manage virtual servers for hosting the web application.
- **Web Server Software:** Tools like Apache or Nginx for serving web application content.
- **SSH:** Secure Shell protocol for connecting to and managing the server remotely.
- **AWS Management Console:** Web-based interface for configuring and managing AWS resources.

### Deployment Process
The deployment process involves setting up an AWS EC2 instance to host the web application. Next, configure the server with necessary software like a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx). Upload the web application files to the server for hosting. Finally, test the application by accessing it via the public IP or domain.

### Outcome
The outcome of this project is a successfully deployed web application hosted on AWS. Participants gain practical knowledge of cloud deployment using AWS services like EC2. They learn to configure servers, manage application hosting, and troubleshoot issues. This project builds foundational skills for cloud computing and web application deployment.
